Absolutely! Let's go through each concept one by one ‚Äî clearly and simply ‚Äî and then tie them together with their relevance for **change detection**.

## üß† **What Are These Metrics?**

### 1. **Precision**

* **What it tells you:** Out of all the changes your model predicted, how many were *actually* changes?
* **Formula:**

  $$
  \text{Precision} = \frac{\text{True Positives}}{\text{True Positives + False Positives}}
  $$
* **High precision = fewer false alarms.**
* üìå Example: If your model detects 100 changes and 80 are correct, precision is 80%.

---

### 2. **Recall**

* **What it tells you:** Out of all the *actual* changes in the image, how many did your model correctly detect?
* **Formula:**

  $$
  \text{Recall} = \frac{\text{True Positives}}{\text{True Positives + False Negatives}}
  $$
* **High recall = fewer missed changes.**
* üìå Example: If there are 100 actual changes and your model catches 70, recall is 70%.

---

### 3. **F1-Score**

* **What it tells you:** A balance between precision and recall.
* **Formula:**

  $$
  \text{F1} = 2 \cdot \frac{\text{Precision} \cdot \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision + Recall}}
  $$
* **Why it's useful:** When you want a single number that balances both missed detections and false alarms.
* üìå Example: If precision is 60% and recall is 40%, F1-score = 48%.

---

### 4. **ROC Curve and AUC**

* **ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) Curve:** Plots the True Positive Rate (Recall) against the False Positive Rate at different thresholds.
* **AUC (Area Under the Curve):** The **area under the ROC curve** ‚Äî higher is better.

#### ‚ûï Simple explanation:

* AUC = 1.0 ‚Üí perfect model.
* AUC = 0.5 ‚Üí random guessing.
* AUC > 0.8 is usually considered **good**.

## üéØ Why These Metrics Matter in **Change Detection**

Change detection = a binary classification task:

* Class 0 = No change
* Class 1 = Change

This task is often **imbalanced** ‚Äî way more "no change" than "change".

### üî• Why Not Just Use Accuracy?

If 95% of the pixels are "no change", a model that says ‚Äúno change‚Äù for everything will get 95% accuracy ‚Äî but it **detects 0% of actual changes** (Recall = 0)!

### ‚úÖ So we focus more on:

* **Recall**: We don't want to *miss* actual changes.
* **Precision**: We don't want *false alarms*.
* **F1-score**: A fair balance between them.
* **AUC**: A good overview of model's discriminative power at different thresholds.

## üîÅ Do These Metrics Affect Each Other?

Yes:

| Tradeoff                                    | Explanation                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| High **Recall** often reduces **Precision** | Model flags more things as "change" to avoid missing any ‚Äî but causes more false positives.                    |
| High **Precision** often reduces **Recall** | Model is stricter ‚Äî it predicts "change" only when very sure, but might miss some.                             |
| **F1-score** balances both                  | Good when classes are imbalanced (which is true in change detection).                                          |
| **AUC** is threshold-independent            | While precision/recall depend on the classification threshold, AUC measures performance across all thresholds. |

## ‚è≥ Does Number of **Epochs** Affect These?

Yes!

| Epochs                 | What Happens                                                                               |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Too Few (underfitting) | Low precision, recall, AUC, accuracy ‚Äî model hasn‚Äôt learned enough.                        |
| Just Right             | Metrics stabilize, model generalizes well.                                                 |
| Too Many (overfitting) | High train metrics, but test metrics drop ‚Äî model memorizes noise instead of generalizing. |

### ‚õèÔ∏è Example from your case:

* ResNet34 (No aug, 30 epochs): Test AUC \~0.83
* ResNet34 (No aug, 50 epochs): Test AUC \~0.84
* ResNet34 (With aug, 50 epochs): Test AUC **\~0.91 ‚úÖ**

So augmentation + right number of epochs = **better generalization**.

## üéì Final Thought

In **change detection**, **recall** and **F1-score** matter **more than accuracy**, because missing a change is often worse than a false alarm. Use **AUC** to evaluate general discrimination, and **F1** to see the precision-recall tradeoff.

Would you like help visualizing these (e.g., ROC curve) or improving recall further (like using focal loss or different thresholding)?
